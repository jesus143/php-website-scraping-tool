I was a tenant at one of Jacqueline Little's management properties. I would definitely recommend her if your looking for a professional property manager. Rest assured your property is in good hands. She was the point person from the initial viewing to the final walk through. I have worked with Jacqueline for over a year and she and her team have been great. I have been very satisfied with her service and would definitely want to work with her when in need of real estate or property management assistance. Any time I needed to contact her she was always on top of getting a back to me and helped resolve any issues that arose. She is very caring and provides a personal touch that makes you feel like a valued customer.", "author": "Carissa H."}, {"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 5}, "datePublished": "2018-12-06", "description": "Amazing all around!\n\nWe recently purchased our vacation condo and needed a reputable property management company to represent us.\n\nWe found it with Royal Realty. Our agent representative Casey went above and beyond to assist us in getting our condo ready for short term rental. We live in California so communication was crucial in all the steps and Casey was attentive and very, very organized! (We thought we were organized but he takes it to another level) He was there to represent us, when our new furniture arrived he was there to coordinate the setup and also stood in for us when the keys to the condo were delivered. Again above and beyond!\n\nOverall because of working with Casey and his company, we never felt pressured or ignored he made the process so smooth. We never had any doubts about the handling of our property. \n\nWe will continue to use his services and also recommend anyone to Royal Realty without any hesitation! \n\nThank you again Casey for your continued hard work!\n\nMahalo!\n\n- The Jio's", "author": "Chris J."}, {"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 5}, "datePublished": "2018-04-12", "description": "Shari Sodetani \u0026 The Team at Royal Realty, LLC were a delightful combination of: professionalism \u0026 genuine client care\n\n* genuine client care:\n+ excellent detailed communication (via preferred method)\n+ listens, makes notes, and then actions.\n+ timely responsiveness\n+ from start to finish ~ alongside you\n\nProfessionalism:\n+ team\n+ industry knowledge \n+ presentation\n+ values: hard work, listening, communication, integrity, honesty, follow up / through, equipping others, etc.\n\nHighly recommend.\n\n10 Stars In My Book", "author": "TrevorL D."}, {"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 5}, "datePublished": "2018-03-15", "description": "Jacqueline Little is the most attentive \u0026 professional property manager I have ever done business with.

She took over my condo from a lame property manager an did excellent job from renovation to quickly finding a new tenant. Apparently basic things like courtesy, being available for communication, and getting stuff done in a timely manner is too hard for a lot of property managers...You will NOT have these issues with Jacqueline.\nAfter my previous tenant moved out, she gave some renovation suggestions which I opted to do and had contractors available to do the work asap. Everything is well documented from the contractor that was used, cost, and scheduling. A lot of online sites was used to market the unit and they also created a video walk through. I was regularly updated on showings which was important to me in case we needed to adjust the rental price. \nIt' been a couple of months and have had no issues. Payment is on time and I'm given a detailed invoice. I should add that I'm working overseas and have never met Jacqueline in person. Everything that was done was through phone and emails.

My roommate is on the mainland so everything had to be done via Internet,  and for two old ladies, that was challenging.  We couldn't have done it without Jennifer's patience and help.  Jennifer has also been a terrific property manager, making sure things are right (this is the first time this unit has been a rental) and everything is in excellent working order.  She was even more concerned than I was about the appliances, which are fine.  As soon as I signed the lease, Jennifer called an appliance repairman to make sure the gas range was working correctly  (it looked quite new to me), so I could cook Easter dinner on the 1st.  \nA big Mahalo to Jennifer and Royal Realty!", "author": "K B."}, {"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 5}, "datePublished": "2018-02-12", "description": "Shari Sodetani is fantastic!

Shari differs from other agents in that she goes above and beyond to service and protect her owners, always being prepared, timely, and ready to take on any situation presented to her. She also cares about her tenants and handles every situation/obstacle to the best of her ability. There's a reason she has a strong network and referrals going her way all the time -- she's trustworthy and builds strong relationships with everyone she encounters.\n\nAs her current tenant, I've had an excellent experience. She is prompt when dealing with repairs/issues with my unit, and when first checking me into my unit, she was very helpful in making sure I understood every part of the lease. She didn't hesitate in answering my questions, and she has been constantly helpful.\n\nShari is of the best of the best, and I highly recommend her to anyone looking for a property manager or realtor.", "author": "Elijah H."}, {"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 5}, "datePublished": "2018-05-16", "description": "I can't express enough just how awesome it was having Kris Masaki as a property manager while I was a renter.

He was extremely cool when it came to moving out too. It was a pretty stressful time for me, but working with Kris definitely made the process easier.
